\section{Context}

The Ethereum blockchain aims to move from the current \gls{pow} consensus
protocol to a \gls{pos} one. Multiple teams are currently researching ways to describe, and implement
such a protocol. One of these teams, lead by Vlad Zamfir, is working on a protocol family called \gls{cbc} Casper.
\gls{cbc}-Casper describes an abstract set of protocols that can achieve consensus between any kind of value, for example
an integer, a vote, or a blockchain. This project aims to find and compare block publishing strategies
for a \gls{cbc}-Casper blockchain consensus.

\section{Objectives}
As the \gls{cbc}-Casper paper only describes an abstract way of consctructing \gls{pos} consensus protocols, and does not
make any assumptions on synchrony, one of the main challenges of the actual implementation is to find
incentive mechanisms and strategies telling the nodes when to produce blocks.
The main goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
        \item to propose multiple block producing strategies;
        \item to create a model that allows one to easily compare said strategies;
        \item to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.
\end{itemize}
